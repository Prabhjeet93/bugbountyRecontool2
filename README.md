 This script automates browser-based web scraping and reporting for a list of URLs. It uses Selenium WebDriver (Chrome, headless) to load each site, interact with cookie consent dialogs, and capture full-page screenshots. The script extracts key page elements (links, buttons, forms, images, meta tags), JavaScript file URLs, and cookies. Results are saved in both an Excel file and a dynamic HTML report, with interactive popups for cookies, JS URLs, and subdomains. The code includes logging for major actions and error handling for failed requests. Designed for bug bounty, security research, and website analysis.
